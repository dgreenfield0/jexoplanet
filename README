READ ME: JEXOPLANET is a Java client for NStED (The NASA Star and Exoplanet Database (NStED)) API.  

From NStED site;
The NASA Star and Exoplanet Database (NStED) collects and serves public data to support the search for and characterization of 
extra-solar planets (exoplanets) and their host stars. 
The data include published light curves, images, spectra and parameters, and time-series data from surveys that aim to discover transiting exoplanets. 
All data are validated by the NStED science staff and traced to their sources. NStED is the U.S. data portal for the CoRoT mission.

This goal of JExoplant is to provide a clran java interface to make it easier to get and consume the Exoplanet data.  

...and, I'm writing an app that'll use this, so might as well share the client.
